			<h1 class="questionfont xxxlarge">How Does Microblading Work?</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="container large answerfont">
			<p>Microblading is a semi-permanent make-up treatment in which a 			pigment is manually inserted into the upper layers of the skin to 			mimic natural hair in your eyebrows. The tattoo fills in gaps 				between your eyebrow hair to give your brows a fuller look. Other 			names for Microblading are 3D eyebrows, eyebrow feathering, 				eyebrow embroidery, microstroking, and micropigmentation. </p>

			<h1 class="questionfont xxxlarge">Is Microblading For Me?</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="container large answerfont">
			<p>Microblading is perfect for you if you have:</p><ul>
			<li>Hair loss</li>
			<li>Lack of definition</li>
			<li>Scars</li></ul>
			<p>Additionally, This is a great option if you want to:</p><ul>

	<div class="margin padding-small">
		<div class="container">
			<h1 class="questionfont xxxlarge">Where Does Microblading Come From?</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="container large answerfont">
			<p>Microblading originated in China, and since then has grown 				substantially in popularity in Europe, Asia, and America. 				Although not much is known about its earlier history, the 				existence of similar techniques can be traced back thousands of 			years. There are myths that microblading was started in Japan, 				but there is little evidence to support this claim, and there 				haven’t been many microblading artists there until a few years 				ago. </p>

	<div class="margin padding-small">
		<div class="container">
			<h1 class="questionfont xxxlarge">Are touchups necessary?</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="container large answerfont">
			<p>Because our bodies recognize the pigment as a foreign 				substance, our immune systems will reject it, which causes 				fading. Microblading is a two-step process. The first touch-up, 			which happens 4-8 weeks after the first procedure, is required. 			This is to correct any irregularities in the color and shape of 			your eyebrows. After the first touchup, generally one to three 				years later, if you notice that the look is wearing off and you 			want to preserve your look, touchups are the way to go.</p>
		</div>
	</div>


	<div class="margin padding-small">
		<div class="container">
			<h1 class="questionfont xxxlarge">Is it Normal for my Eyebrows to be 				Scabbing?</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="container large answerfont">
			<p>Yes! Scabbing is part of you skin’s healing process. After a 			week or so, most, if not all, of the scabs should have fallen 				off, and you should notice a lighter brow and color. Scabbing 				happens because the microblading process involves making shallow 			cuts into your skin. The cuts are not deep enough to result in a 			permanent tattoo, but it does trigger an immune system response 			from your body.</p>
		</div>
	</div>


	<div class="margin padding-small">
		<div class="container">
			<h1 class="questionfont xxxlarge">Can I Pick my Scabs?</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="container large answerfont">
			<p>No! Under no circumstances should you pick at your scabs. This 			can cause the pigment to fall out, and you run the risk of losing 			all the progress from your first treatment. You must let your 				scabs fall off naturally. If you have a problem with your scabs, 			you may <b>gently</b> wash your eyebrows <b>under warm water.				</b></p>
		</div>
	</div>



	<div class="margin padding-small">
		<div class="container">
			<h1 class="questionfont xxxlarge">How Long Does it Take Microbladed Brows 			to Fade?</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="container large answerfont">
			<p>The speed at which your brows fade depends on many factors. 				Oily skin, certain medications and medical conditions can cause 			the pigment to fade at different rates. Everyone’s facial 				features are unique, and more or less frequent touchups may be 				necessary to maintain the microbladed look, depending on your 				features. It may take anywhere from one to three years for your 			brow color to fade.</p>
		</div>
	</div>


	<div class="margin padding-small">
		<div class="container">
			<h1 class="questionfont xxxlarge">My Eyebrows are Too Dark!</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="container large answerfont">
			<p>Fret not! The first few weeks, your eyebrows will go through 			the healing period. After this is over, and if you’ve followed 				proper aftercare, your eyebrows will become lighter in color, and 			swelling, scabs, will disappear / fall off. It’s completely 				normal for the color to be much darker right after the procedure. 			During the healing process, the color will fade slightly, 				revealing softer and more natural brows. If the color is fading 			too much, you can bring up any problems you have during the 				touchup session. </p>
		</div>
	</div>


	<div class="margin padding-small">
		<div class="container">
			<h1 class="questionfont xxxlarge">What should I Avoid Doing After My 				Microblading Treatment?</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="container large answerfont">
			<p>To take care of your eyebrows properly after the procedure, 				avoid touching, scratching, picking, peeling your eyebrows, as 				well as sun exposure, makeup, moisturizer, lotion, sunscreen, or 			exfoliation. Don’t engage in activities that induce sweating, 				avoid strong winds (ex.driving with the windows down), alcohol, 			hot baths, showers, saunas, jacuzzis, and swimming.</p>

	<div class="margin padding-small">
		<div class="container">
			<h1 class="questionfont xxxlarge">Can My Eyebrows Get Wet?</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="container large answerfont">
			<p>Yes! In fact, you should wash your eyebrows daily with soap 				and water. Be <b>gentle</b>; rub the area softly and smoothly. 				Make sure you rinse thoroughly, and blot the area dry with a 				clean towel or tissue.</p>
